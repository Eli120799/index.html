                <h2>Early Childhood</h2>

               <h3>
                <p>Eminem or Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born in October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph Missouri. Marshall had a rough childhood. His father left Eminem and his mother when Eminem was just 6 months old. Eminem tried contacting his father many times but, his father rebuffed all of his son's attempts to reach out to him. Eminem was raised by his single mother, Deborah Mathers. She could never hold down one job and was always in the hunt for a job. As a result they moved constantly between Missouri and Detroit, Michigan. "I would change schools two, three times a year" Eminem said in an interview. The moving constantly from one place to another, switching schools frequently, and being raised by his mother alone, left a lot of damage and impacted his personality. Eminem didn't really have any close friends, he was always alone, he was also treated as an outcast. A reason why he was treated so poorly by his classmates was because he was sometimes the only white kid in an African American neighborhood and was bullied for being White, "Beat up in the bathroom, beat up in the hallways, shoved into lockers," he said. Eminem attended Lincoln High School in Warren, Michigan, he failed ninth grade three times, he dropped out at the age of 17. Even though Eminem was a poor student, he would always study the dictionary and was always into comic books. Since Eminem was a dropout, he found his way to express his passion for lenguage, as well to release all his anger. He was common with the nihilistic rage of late-1980's. At age 14, he started rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they came up with the names "Manix" and "M&M" which later it evolved into "Eminem". Eminem would also sneak into Osborn High School with his best friend and rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On saturday's they would attend to open mic battles at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile, cosidered ground-zero for the Detroit rap scene. Despite his race, Eminem was soon appreciated by underground hip hop audiences.</p>
